4.4.1 Respiration
---

___

a) outline why plants, animals and microorganisms need to respire, with reference to active transport and metabolic reactions;

b) describe, with the aid of diagrams, the structure of ATP;

c) statethatATPprovidestheimmediate source of energy for biological processes;

d) explain the importance of coenzymes in respiration, with reference to NAD and coenzyme A;

e) state that glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm;

f) outline the process of glycolysis beginning with the phosphorylation of glucose to hexose bisphosphate, splitting of hexose bisphosphate into two triose phosphate molecules and further oxidation to pyruvate, producing a small yield of ATP and reduced NAD;

g) state that, during aerobic respiration in animals, pyruvate is actively transported into mitochondria;

h) explain, with the aid of diagrams and electron micrographs, how the structure of mitochondria enables them to carry out their functions;

i) state that the link reaction takes place in the mitochondrial matrix;

j) outline the link reaction, with reference to decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetate and the reduction of NAD;

k) explainthatacetateiscombinedwith coenzyme A to be carried to the next stage;

l) state that the Krebs cycle takes place in the mitochondrial matrix;

m) outline the Krebs cycle, with reference to the formation of citrate from acetate and oxaloacetate and the reconversion of citrate to oxaloacetate (names of intermediate compounds are not required);

n) explain that during the Krebs cycle, decarboxylation and dehydrogenation occur, NAD and FAD are reduced and substrate level phosphorylation occurs;

o) outline the process of oxidative phosphorylation, with reference to the roles of electron carriers, oxygen and the mitochondrial cristae;

p) outline the process of chemiosmosis, with reference to the electron transport chain, proton gradients and ATPsynthase (HSW7a);

q) state that oxygen is the final electron acceptor in aerobic respiration;

r) evaluate the experimental evidence for the theory of chemiosmosis (HSW1);

s) explainwhythetheoreticalmaximumyield of ATP per molecule of glucose is rarely, if ever, achieved in aerobic respiration;

t) explain why anaerobic respiration produces a much lower yield of ATP than aerobic respiration;

u) compare and contrast anaerobic respiration in mammals and in yeast;

v) definethetermrespiratorysubstrate;

w) explain the difference in relative energy values of carbohydrate, lipid and protein respiratory substrates.
