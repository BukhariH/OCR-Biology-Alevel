5.2.3 Genomes and Gene Technologies
---

* a) outline the steps involved in sequencing the genome of an organism;

* b) outline how gene sequencing allows for genome-wide comparisons between individuals and between species (HSW7b);

* c) define the term recombinant DNA;

* d) explain that genetic engineering involves the extraction of genes from one organism, or the manufacture of genes, in order to place them in another organism (often of a different species) such that the receiving organism expresses the gene product (HSW6a);

* e) describe how sections of DNA containing a desired gene can be extracted from a donor organism using restriction enzymes;

* f) outline how DNA fragments can be separated by size using electrophoresis (HSW3);

* g) describe how DNA probes can be used to identify fragments containing specific sequences;

* h) outline how the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to make multiple copies of DNA fragments;

* i) explain how isolated DNA fragments can be placed in plasmids, with reference to the role of ligase;

* j) state other vectors into which fragments of DNA may be incorporated;

* k) explain how plasmids may be taken up by bacterial cells in order to produce a transgenic microorganism that can express a desired gene product;

* l) describe the advantage to microorganisms of the capacity to take up plasmid DNA from the environment;

* m) outline how genetic markers in plasmids can be used to identify the bacteria that have taken up a recombinant plasmid;

* n) outline the process involved in the genetic engineering of bacteria to produce human insulin;

* o) outline the process involved in the genetic engineering of ‘Golden RiceTM’ (HSW6a);

* p) outline how animals can be genetically engineered for xenotransplantation (HSW6a, 6b);

* q) explain the term gene therapy;

* r) explain the differences between somatic cell gene therapy and germ line cell gene therapy;

* s) discuss the ethical concerns raised by the genetic manipulation of animals (including humans), plants and microorganisms (HSW4, 6a, 6b, 7c).
