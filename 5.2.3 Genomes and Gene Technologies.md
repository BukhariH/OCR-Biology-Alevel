5.2.3 Genomes and Gene Technologies
---

* a) outline the steps involved in sequencing the genome of an organism;
	* The sequencing reaction can only operate on a length of 750 bp.
	* For accuracy we carry out sequencing on overlapping fragments.
	* Prep Stages:
		* First the genomes are mapped to identify which part of the genome they have come from.
			* They are mapped using information already avaible such as the location of 3-4 bp __microsatalites__ 
			* The samples are __sheared__ (mechanically broken)
				* This is known as the __shotgun approach__
			* These sections are placed into __BACs (bacterial artifical chromosomes)__	and transferred into E. coli (bacterial) cells.
			* As the cells grow they produces lots of copies
				* These is referred to as __clone libaries__
	* BACs sequencing stages:
		* Cells containing specfic BACs are taken and cultured. 
		* The DNA is extracted from the cells and restriction enzymes used to cut it into smaller fragments.
			* Use of different restriction enzymes gives the varying fragment size.
		* The fragments are seperated using an automated process.
		* Computer software then compares overlapping reigions from the different fragments and reassemble the whole BAC.

* b) outline how gene sequencing allows for genome-wide comparisons between individuals and between species (HSW7b);
	* The process of comparing genes from one organism with another in know as __comparative gene mapping__
	* Applications:
		* Identification of universal genes is an indicator for the importance of that gene for life
		* Shows evolutionary relationships
		* Allows as to carry out modelling to see the effects of gene mutations
		* Identify the genes or base pairs that cause disease
		* DNA of individuals can be analysed to see if there are any high risk alleles

* c) define the term recombinant DNA;
	* A section of DNA (often a plasmid) which is formed by joinning DNA sections from two different sources 

* d) explain that genetic engineering involves the extraction of genes from one organism, or the manufacture of genes, in order to place them in another organism (often of a different species) such that the receiving organism expresses the gene product (HSW6a);

* e) describe how sections of DNA containing a desired gene can be extracted from a donor organism using restriction enzymes;

* f) outline how DNA fragments can be separated by size using electrophoresis (HSW3);

* g) describe how DNA probes can be used to identify fragments containing specific sequences;

* h) outline how the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to make multiple copies of DNA fragments;

* i) explain how isolated DNA fragments can be placed in plasmids, with reference to the role of ligase;

* j) state other vectors into which fragments of DNA may be incorporated;
	* A pacakged gene can be a large molecule hence difficult to get across the membrane hence various vectors are used:
	* Electroporation - A high voltage is used to disrupt the membrane so the molecule can pass through
	* Microinjection - DNA is injected using a very fine micropipette
	* Viral Transfer - Methods uses the virus's mechanism for infecting cells by adding DNA
	* Ti plamids can be into the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. 
		* The bacterium then inserts the plasmids into the plants genome 
	* Liposomes - DNA is wrapped in lipid molecules. These are fat-soluable hence can cross the lipid membrane via diffusion.

* k) explain how plasmids may be taken up by bacterial cells in order to produce a transgenic microorganism that can express a desired gene product;

* l) describe the advantage to microorganisms of the capacity to take up plasmid DNA from the environment;

* m) outline how genetic markers in plasmids can be used to identify the bacteria that have taken up a recombinant plasmid;

* n) outline the process involved in the genetic engineering of bacteria to produce human insulin;

* o) outline the process involved in the genetic engineering of ‘Golden RiceTM’ (HSW6a);

* p) outline how animals can be genetically engineered for xenotransplantation (HSW6a, 6b);

* q) explain the term gene therapy;

* r) explain the differences between somatic cell gene therapy and germ line cell gene therapy;

* s) discuss the ethical concerns raised by the genetic manipulation of animals (including humans), plants and microorganisms (HSW4, 6a, 6b, 7c).
