Open Source OCR A-Level Biology Course Notes and Specification

Sometimes we link to other websites which provide awesome content to revise from! Usually there's an icon which can be clicked and takes you to the relevant section.

For example in [4.1.2 Nerves](https://github.com/BukhariH/OCR-Biology-Alevel/blob/master/4.1.2%20Nerves.md) you see:

[![Khan Academy Icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/0j0g3f2t2i0i2O1B163w/favicon.ico)](https://www.khanacademy.org) and when you see the leaf; you know it represents Khan Academy.
