4.3.1 Photosynthesis
---

* a) define the terms autotroph and heterotroph;

* b) state that light energy is used during photosynthesis to produce complex organic molecules;

* c) explain how respiration in plants and animals depends upon the products of photosynthesis;

* d) state that in plants photosynthesis is a two- stage process taking place in chloroplasts;

* e) explain, with the aid of diagrams and electron micrographs, how the structure of chloroplasts enables them to carry out their functions;

* f) define the term photosynthetic pigment;
	* Photosynthetic pigments are molecules that absorb light energy.
	* Each pigment absorbs a specific wavelength of light in the visible light region
	* Each pigment also has specific peak of absorption
	* Wavelengths outside the range a reflected
	* This reflected light is the colour which they appear to us as

* g) explain the importance of photosynthetic pigments in photosynthesis;
	* Photosynthetic Pigments are held in place by proteins in the thylakoid membranes
	* They are arranged in a funnel shape structure called a photosystem
	* There are two type of pigments:
		* **Primary Pigments**
			* Structure:
				* Consist of a long phytol chain and porphyrin group
					* The porphrin group is similar to the haem group but contains Magnesium instead of Iron
			* Light hitting the chlorophyll causes a pair of electrons belonging to Magnesium to become excited
			* Primary pigments are Chlorophyll a and Chlorophyll b
				* Chlorophyll a has two forms - P680 and P700
					* They both appear yellow-green
					* Each absorb red light at slightly different wavelengths
					* Both also absorb blue light around the wavelength of 450 nm
					* Both are found in the **Primary Pigment Reaction Centre**
					* P680 is found in photosystem I
					* P700 is found in photosystem II
				* Chlorophyll b absorbs light around wavelength of 500 nm and 640 nm
					* it appears blue-green
		* **Accessory Pigments**
			* They absorb wavelengths that chlorophyll doesn't absorb well and pass the energy down to chlorophyll
			* Carotenoid absorb blue light and reflect yellow and orange light
			* Not directly involved in the light dependent reaction
			* Do not contain the porphyrin (magnesium) group
			* Carotene (orange) and xanthophyll (yellow) are the main carotenoid pigments

* h) state that the light-dependent stage takes place in thylakoid membranes and that the light-independent stage takes place in the stroma;

* i) outline how light energy is converted to chemical energy (ATP and reduced NADP) in the light-dependent stage (reference should be made to cyclic and non-cyclic photo phosphorylation, but no biochemical detail is required);

* j) explain the role of water in the light-dependent stage;

* k) outline how the products of the light- dependent stage are used in the light- independent stage (Calvin cycle) to produce triose phosphate (TP) (reference should be made to ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (rubisco) and glycerate 3-phosphate (GP), but no other biochemical detail is required);

* l) explain the role of carbon dioxide in the light-independent stage (Calvin cycle);

* m) state that TP can be used to make carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids;

* n) state that most TP is recycled to RuBP;

* o) describe the effect on the rate of photosynthesis, and on levels of GP, RuBP and TP, of changing carbon dioxide concentration, light intensity and temperature;

* p) discuss limiting factors in photosynthesis with reference to carbon dioxide concentration, light intensity and temperature;

* q) describe how to investigate experimentally the factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis (HSW3).
