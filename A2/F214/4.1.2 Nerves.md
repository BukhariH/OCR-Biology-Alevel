4.1.2 Nerves
---

* a) outline the roles of sensory receptors in mammals in converting different forms of energy into nerve impulses;
	* Sensory receptors are energy transducers which convert one form on energy to another. Nerves convert stimuli (which come in different forms such as heat and pressure) into electrical impulses which are carried to the central nervous system (CNS).


		| Receptor        |     Energy changes detected       |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
|Light Sensitive cells (rods and cones)| Light energy and a range of wavelengths |
|Olfactory cells in the nose| Sensitive to volatile chemicals |
|Taste buds, hard palate, epiglottis and the first part of the oesophagus| Presence of soluble chemicals |
|Pressure receptors in the skin| Pressure on skin |
|Sound receptors in the inner ear| Vibrations in the air |
|Muscle spindles| Length of muscle fibres |


* b) describe, with the aid of diagrams, the structure and functions of sensory and motor neurones; [![Khan Academy Icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/0j0g3f2t2i0i2O1B163w/favicon.ico) ](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology/neuron-nervous-system/v/anatomy-of-a-neuron)

	* Important Features:
		* Each cell has cell body (soma)
		* Each communicates with a process starting from the cell body
		* Processes which carry signals ** *away* from the cell body** are called **"Axons"**
		* Processes which carry signals ** *to* the cell body** are called **"Dendrons"**

* c) describe and explain how the resting potential is established and maintained;
	* No Action Potential means the neurone is at a resting potential.
	* At a resting potential Na+ Ions diffuse in and are then expelled by a Sodium-Potassium Pump which using ATP (actively) transports NA+ ions out and K+ ions in against the concentration gradient.
	* For every two K+ ions transported into the axon 3 Na+ ions are transported out.
	* This causes the membrane to become polarised in relation to the outside of the cell as the outside of the cell is more positive than the inside of the cell.
		* This causes a **resting potential** of ***-60mV***.
		* The cytoplasm of a cell also contains anions which causes the inside of the cell to be even less positive.

* d) describe and explain how an action potential is generated;
	* All action potentials in a neurone are the same size. Only frequency increases due to a larger stimuli
	* Generating an Action Potential is a two part process:
		* i) The depolarisation of the membrane
		* ii) The repolarisation of the membrane
	* Depolarisation
		* At rest gated Na+ Ion channels are closed in the membrane however some K+ ion channels are still open
			* Hence some of the K+ ions leave the cell
		* In the generator region, Na+ ion channels open because of energy changes.
			* An example would be the gated Na+ ions channels in the Pacinian corpuscle (detects pressure change) which are opened by deformation.
		*  Na+ ion channels open allowing Na+ ions to flood into the axon causing the inside of the cell to be less negative than the outside of the cell
			* A membrane is said to be depolarised after it reaches a **threshold value** of ***-50mV***
		* The ions spread sideways and away from the region of increased charge inside the axon
			* This process is called Local Current
		* This change is detected by voltage-gated sodium ion channels which open and allow Na+ ions to flood into the cell
			* The potential difference reaches values of ***+40mV*** when the inside is compared to the outside

	* Repolarisation
		* After reaching 40mV Na+ ion channels close and K+ ion channels open so K+ ions leave the cell via diffusion down the gradient
			* The potential difference has overshooted hence the cell is Hyperpolarised
		* Now the Sodium-Potassium pumps start to actively transport the Na+ ions that flood in, out of the cell and brings back the K+ ions.
			* They exchange in the ratio of 3 Na + ions leave the cell for 2 K+ ions


* e) describe and explain how an action potential is transmitted in a myelinated neurone, with reference to the roles of voltage-gated sodium ion and potassium ion channels;

* f) interpret graphs of the voltage changes taking place during the generation and transmission of an action potential;

* g) outline the significance of the frequency of impulse transmission;

* h) compare and contrast the structure and function of myelinated and non-myelinated neurones;

* i) describe, with the aid of diagrams, the structure of a cholinergic synapse;

* j) outline the role of neurotransmitters in the transmission of action potentials;

* k) outline the roles of synapses in the nervous system.
