5.1.1 Cellular Control
---

* a) state that genes code for polypeptides, including enzymes;
	* A gene is a length of DNA that codes for one or more polypeptides.

* b) explain the meaning of the term genetic code;
	* A sequence of nucleotide bases on a gene that provides a code with instructions for the construction of a polypeptide or protein.
	* Characteristics:
		* A triplet code (sequence of three nucleotide bases).
		* It is a degenerate code (several codes result in the production of the same amino acids except for methionie).
		* Some codes don't code for amino acids but rather mean **STOP**.
		* Widespread but not universal. The codes usually produce the same result in most organisms but there are exceptions.

* c) describe, with the aid of diagrams, the way in which a nucleotide sequence codes for the amino acid sequence in a polypeptide;
	*  TODO: UPLOAD

* d) describe, with the aid of diagrams, how the sequence of nucleotides within a gene is used to construct a polypeptide, including the roles of messenger RNA, transfer RNA and ribosomes;
	* TODO

* e) state that mutations cause changes to the sequence of nucleotides in DNA molecules;
	* Two classes of DNA mutations:
		* **Point mutations** in which one base pair replaces another. Also, called substitutions.
		* **Insertions** & **deletions** in which a nucleotide is inserted or deleted and these cause frame shifts.


* f) explain how mutations can have beneficial, neutral or harmful effects on the way a protein functions;
	* If a gene is altered at the base sequence then it becomes another version of the same gene. These various versions are called **alleles**.
	* Neutral Effects:
		* These happen when:
			* a mutation occurs in the non-coding part of the DNA.
			* a silent mutation where the new base triplet still codes for the same amino acid.
	* Beneficial/Harmful Effects:
		* Melanin is a pigment which protects humans from the effects of UV light and causes colour of the skin to be darker.
		* Because of the intense amount of sunlight in Africa (where humans originated) UV light was still able to get past the melanin and help with the production of vitamin D.
		* However, as humans migrated more towards the temperate regions; the high concentration of melanin was preventing enough sunlight to reach the skin for vitamin D synthesis.
		* Hence, humans in these temperate ares started having diseases such as rickets or in women narrow pelvises (would often brake during child birth).
		* Therefore, those with the mutation that codes for the lower production of melanin (paler skin) were able to absorb more sunlight for vitamin D synthesis and therefore avoided rickets.
		* This was a beneficial advantage in temperate regions but was extremely harmful back in our home of Africa.

* g) state that cyclic AMP activates proteins by altering their three-dimensional structure;
	* Not all proteins and enzymes are activated when they are created. Instead cyclic AMP binds to these proteins altering their tertiary structure making them better fit their substrate.

* h) explain genetic control of protein production in a prokaryote using the lac operon [![YouTube Icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/1f3r3D191I2T0N3g3333/favicon-vfldLzJxy.ico)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10YWgqmAEsQ);
	*  In order for Ecoli to breakdown Lactose it needs to enzymes:
    	* Beta-Glactosidase
        * Lactose Permease
	* When there is no Lactose:
		* Beacause there is no lactose in the system; a repressor protein binds to the operon at the operator control site.
    	* Hence it covers the area where RNA polymerase usually binds.
        * This prevents expression of the structural genes.
    * When there is Lactose:
    	* Lactose binds to the repressor protein which changes the tertairy structure of the gene.
        * This causes the binding between the operon and the repressor protien to brake.
       	* Now, RNA polymerase can bind to the Operon at the promoter control site. 
        * This allows the structural genes to be expressed.
	* A good way to remember it is rProg:
    	* r - Regulator Gene (Produces the repressor protein)
        * P - Promoter Gene (binding site for RNA polymerase)
        * o - Operator Gene (binding site for the Repressor Protein produced by the regulator gene)
        * g - Genes (The structural genes for Beta-glactosidase & lactose permease)

* i) explain that the genes that control development of body plans are similar in plants, animals and fungi, with reference to homeobox sequences (HSW1);
	* TODO

* j) outline how apoptosis (programmed cell death) can act as a mechanism to change body plans.
	* Essentially, a controlled self destruction of the cell.
		* You may remember from AS-Level that we said that lysosomes had a function of destroying the cell. Well, lysosomes contain the enzymes required for apoptosis.
	* Sequence:
		* Enzymes releases from lysosomes breakdown cell cytoskeleton
		* Cytoplasm becomes dense with packed organelles
		* The cell surface membrane changes and small bits called **blebs form**
		* Chromatin condenses and the nuclear envelope breaks
		* The cell brakes into vesicles which are taken up by **phagocytosis**
		* All this happens very quickly and without causing damage to other cells
	* Controlling Apoptosis:
		* A wide variety of internal & external cell signals control apoptosis.
		* Cell signals include:
			* cytokines made by the immune system
			* hormones
			* growth factors
			* nitric oxide
				* Induces apoptosis by making the membrane more permeable to H+ ions hence dissipating the H+ gradient
			* Proteins released into the cystosol (the fluid inside a cell) which bind to apotheosis inhibitor proteins hence allow for apoptosis to take place.
	* Development:
		* Initially, our cells divide excessively and then apoptosis culls these cells so that their components can be used else where. 
		* Examples:
			* It weeds out harmful or useless T-Lymphocytes.
			* During limb development apoptosis causes the separation of our fingers & toes.
		* The rate of apoptosis should balance the rate of mitosis. If they aren't balanced:
			* not enough apoptosis leads to formation of tumours
			* too much leads to cell loss
