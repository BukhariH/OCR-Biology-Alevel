5.2.1 Cloning in Plants and Animals
---

* a) outline the differences between reproductive and non-reproductive cloning;
	* The aim of reproductive cloning is to produce new animals whilst the aim of non-reproductive cloning is to form new cells, tissues and organs.
	*  Advantages of cloned cells
		* Cells will no longer be rejected as they are not 'foreign'
		* End waiting for organs
		* Totipotent hence can differentiate into any cell
		* Less dangerous than a major operation
	

* b) describe the production of natural clones in plants using the example of vegetative propagation in elm trees;
	* Asexual Reproduction:

| Advantages        | Disadvantages  |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| quick hence organisms can take advantages of the resources around them. | does not produce any genetic variety creating monocultures and leaving offspring vulnerable to parental weakness. |
| can be completed if sexual reproduction fails | |
| All offspring have the genetic information which allows them to survive | |

	* Vegetative propagation
		* Refers to the production of structures in an organisms that can grow into new individual organisms. These offspring contain the same genetic information as the parent hence they are clones. 
		* Example:
			* Elm trees produce meristem close to the base of the trunk (where damage is least likely to have taken)
 which allows the tree to produce root suckers (or **basal sprouts**) incase of damage to the main trunk.
 			* These root suckers help the elm spread by forming a circle of sprouts around the dying trunk called the **clonal patch**. 
 			* These trees produce more basal sprouts hence the elm tree spreads
 		* The disadvantage to this technique is that there is no variation. If the parent died of a disease then these offsprings are also venerable to that disease.
* c) describe the production of artificial clones of plants from tissue culture;
	* Three common ways of artificially cloning a plant:
		* Taking cuttings
			* A section is cut between the leaf joins
			* The end cut is treated with nutrients and growth promoting plant hormones 
			* Then the cutting is planted and the cutting forms a clone of the parent
		* Grafting
			* A shoot of a woody plant is cut and joined to the already growing root and stem.
			* The graft is genetically identical to the parent but the rootstock isn't
		* Tissue culture (used to produce huge numbers of clones)
			* Tissue culture refers to the separation of any tissue type and their growth in or on a nutrient medium.
			* Micropropagation by callus tissue culture
				* A small piece of tissue is taken from the plant to be cloned (usually from the tip of the shoot)
					* This is called an explant
				* The explant is placed on a growth medium
				* Cells in the tissue divide but they do not differentiate. Instead they form a mass of undifferentiated cells called a **callus**.
				* After a few weeks, single callus cells can be removed from the mass and be placed on a shoot growing medium
				* After a few more weeks it's removed and put on a root growing medium
				* The plants are then transferred to the greenhouse.
				

* d) discuss the advantages and disadvantages of plant cloning in agriculture (HSW6a, 6b, 7c);
	* 	| Advantages        | Disadvantages  |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| Allows for the production of plants with good characteristics such as high yield  | reduced genetic variation |
| costs are reduced as the plant is ready for harvest at the same time | distances between plants limited by regulation to prevent spread of pathogens |
| much faster than selective breeding | |


* e) describe how artificial clones of animals can be produced;
	* Only totipotent stem cells (embryonic cells) can differentiate into any type of cell
	* Two ways of cloning:
		* Splitting Embryos
			* Cells from a developing embryo are separated and they form genetically identical siblings.
		* Nuclear transfer
			* A differentiated cell and it's nucleus are taken and then it's nucleus is placed into a enucleated cell. The egg then goes through the normal stages of development using information from the donated nucleus.

* f) discuss the advantages and disadvantages of cloning animals (HSW4, 6a, 6b, 7c).
	* 	| Advantages        | Disadvantages  |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| High value animals with good characteristics can be cloned in large numbers  | animal welfare not in mind |
| rare animals can be cloned to preserve species | lowers genetic diversity |
| Genetically modified animals can be quickly reproduced| still unclear whether animals produced with nuclear transfer will live a healthy life |
