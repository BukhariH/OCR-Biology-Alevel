5.3.2 Populations and Sustainability
---

* a) explain the significance of limiting factors in determining the final size of a population;
	* A habitat cannot support a population ledger because of factors that limit poplulation size.
	* Factors:
		* food
		* water
		* light
		* oxygen
		* space
		* shelter
		* parasites/predators
		* competition

* b) explain the meaning of the term carrying capacity;
	* Maximum population size that can be maintained over a period of time by a particular habitat

* c) describe predator–prey relationships and their possible effects on the population sizes of both the predator and the prey;
	* Predation can act is a limiting factor on the population of prey which can then be a limiting factor on the population of the predator. 
	* Predators population increases hence more prey are eaten
	* Prey population gets smaller hence less food for predators
	* Less food hence fewer predators survive
	* Fewer predators hence fewer prey eaten hence prey population increases
	* More prey hence more food hence higher predator population 

* d) explain, with examples, the terms interspecific and intraspecific competition;
	* Intraspecific
		* Competition between members of the same species.
		* Survival of the fittest
			* The best adapted will survive
		* Stationary Phase hence stable population
			* Population size decreases hence competition decreases hence population increases
			* Population size increases hence competition increases hence population decreases
	* Interspecific
		* Competition between different species hence can effect the population size of a species and the distribution
		* Example:
			* Two species of Paramecium - Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum
			* Both occupied the same niche however Paramecium aurelia was better adapted
			* Paramecium caudatum died out
			* This is know as **competitive exclusion principle**
		* This may not always be the case in real life as there are natural limiting factors which might prevent the growth of one of the species
		

* e) distinguish between the terms conservation and preservation (HSW6a, 6b);
	* Conservation
		* Active management and reclamation of land
	* Preservation 
 		* Protecting land and leaving it in it's untouched form e.g. National Parks

* f) explain how the management of an ecosystem can provide resources in a sustainable way, with reference to timber production in a temperate country;
	* Sustainable Management
		* Sustainable management means maintaining biodiversity whilst also financially securing timber production companies. 
	* Small Scale Timber Production
		* Coppicing
			* Cutting a deciduous tree close to the ground to encourage shoots to grow
			* These shoots can be cut and used for fencing, firewood or furniture
			* Once cut new shoots grow and the cycle continues
		* Pollarding
			* Same as coppicing but higher up
			* This is to keep them out of reach of herbivores like deers
		* Rotation Coppicing
			* Dividing a woodland into sections and cutting down different sections at a time to allow the other sections to regrow
			* Some trees are left to produce larger timber these are called **standards**
			* Very good for biodiversity as unmanaged woodlands end up going through secondary succession thus blocking out light to the woodland floor
	* Large Scale Timber Production 
		* Clear-felling
			* All the trees in an area are cut down
			* This reduces mineral levels and leaves soil susceptible to erosion
			* Leaving each section of the woodland for 50-100 years before felling is economically unviable
			* Modern Sustainable Practices:	
				* Any tree harvested is replaced by another tree
				* The ecological function of a forrest is not disturbed by the extraction of timber
				* Local people derive benefit
		* Selective cutting
			* Cut down only the most valuable trees hence the biodiversity in maintained and the habitat unaffected
		* If each tree supplies more wood then less trees need to be cut down hence foresters:
			*  control pests and pathogens
			* only plant tree species they know will grow well
			* position trees optimal distances apart

* g) explain that conservation is a dynamic process involving management and reclamation;
	* Conservation required careful management to maintain a stable community
	* Strategies to manage conservation:
		* Increasing carrying capacity by providing more food
		* Move individuals to enlarge populations or help with the natural dispersion
		* Restrict dispersal of individuals by fencing
		* Control predators and poachers
		* Vaccination against diseases
		* Preservation of habitats
	* Sometimes simple management is the wrong technique as disruption might be so great that secondary succession might start to occur.

* h) discuss the economic, social and ethical reasons for conservation of biological resources (HSW6b, 7c);
	* Economic Reasons
		* Many species are a valuable food source
		* Genetic diversity of wild strains may provide useful characteristics in the future
		* Provide access to drugs that we may use in the future
		* Natural predators of pests can act as biological control agents
		* Wild insects help pollinate plants
		* Reduction in biodiversity leads to reduced climate stability 
	* Social Reasons
		* Ecotourism has an aesthetic value 
		
	* Ethical Reasons
		* Every species has an intrinsic value and a right to survive.
	 

* i) outline, with examples, the effects of human activities on the animal and plant populations in the Galapagos Islands (HSW6b).
	* Habitat Disturbance
		* Dramatic increase in population has placed demands on water, energy and sanitation services
		* Increases pollution, expansion of agricultural land and building have destroyed the habitat
	* Over exploitation of resources
		* Seal and whale hunters killed large populations of the animals faster than they could replenish
		* Tortoises need little food and could be stored on ships for long time as a source of food
		* Demand for exotic marine life such as the sea cucumber and shark fins have devastated populations
	* Introduction of new species
		* Humans on purpose brought some species on to the islands such as goats, cats, fruits and vegetables and not on purpose brought over other species such as rats and insects.
		* These new species out competed the locals, destroyed native habitats and just out right ate the locals.
		* Combated this by:
			* Adding a new quarantine system to prevent the introduction of non native species by tourists
			* Natural predators exploited to kill pests 
			* Culling of feral goats and pigs
