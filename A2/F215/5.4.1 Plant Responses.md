5.4.1 Plant Responses
---

* a) explain why plants need to respond to their environment in terms of the need to avoid predation and abiotic stress;
	* To avoid stress
	* To avoid being eaten
	* To survive long enough to reproduce

* b) define the term tropism;
	* Tropism is a direction growth response in which the direction of the response is determined by the direction of the stimuli.
	* These include:
		* Phototropism - shoots growing towards light
		* Geotropism - root growing towards the pull of gravity
		* Chemotropism - pollen tubes grow down the style attracted by chemicals
		* Thigmotropism	 - shoots of climbing plants

* c) explain how plant responses to environmental changes are co-ordinated by hormones, with reference to responding to changes in light direction;
	*  Auxins stimulate growth by causing cell elongation.
	* They increase the strictness of the cell wall by promoting active transport of H+ ions by ATPase
	* This provides low pH for the expansions enzymes to loosen the wall
	* The enzymes breakdown bonds within the cellulose which makes the wall less rigid


* d) evaluate the experimental evidence for the role of auxins in the control of apical dominance and gibberellin in the control of stem elongation;
	* Auxins
		* Auxins prevent lateral buds from forming.
			* This is called **Apical Dominance**
		* When the tip of the plant is removed auxins levels decrease which allows lateral buds to form.
		* Years later further research said that auxin levels actually increased after the tip was cut off.
		* This lead two other hormones being linked to apical dominance
			* Abcisic Acid which inhibits bud growth.
				* High concentrations of auxins may keep abcisic acid conc high prevent lateral bud growth
			* Cytokinins which promote bud growth
				* High concentrations of auxins might make the shoot apex a sink for cytokinins
				* Low concentrations of auxins may evenly distribute cytokinins hence the lateral bud growth

	* Gebbrellins
		* Cause cell elongation and cell devision in dwarf plants


* e) outline the role of hormones in leaf loss in deciduous plants;
	* Cytokinins prevent the leaves of deciduous plants from senescing (ageing) by making the leaf a sink for phloem transport
	* Hence when the supply of cytokinins drop that means that there are no longer enough nutrients going to leaves hence they die
	* Usually, Auxins prevent the leafs from abscission by acting on cells in the abscission zone but in senescing:
		* the auxin production on the tip of the leaf falls and ethene production increases
		* this makes the abscission zone more sensitive to ethene
		* Ethene increases the production of cellulase which digests the wall of the cells in the abscission zone
		* eventually the leaves shed

* f) describe how plant hormones are used commercially (HSW6a).
	* Auxins
		* Cuttings
			* Dippings ends of a cutting promotes root growth
		* Seedless fruit
			* Applying auxins to unpollinated plants creates seedless fruit
		* Herbicides
			* Artificial Auxins are transported in the phloem via mass flow
			* They can't be broken down by enzymes as they are not a close fit
			* But the still cause shoot growth till the plant can no longer support it self
	* Gibberellins
		* Fruit Production
			* Delay senescence in citrus fruit
			* elongate apples for a better shape
			* Allow grape stalks to elongate to support bigger grapes
		* Brewing
			* Speeds up the production of amylase to breakdown starch into maltose
		* Sugar production
			* Stimulates growth between nodes on sugar cane where sugar is stored.
			* Hence increases yield
		* Plant breeding
			* Lowers generation time by inducing seed production in young trees
			* Stopping plants making gibberellins can help keep plants small and stocky - for example.

	* Cytokinins
		* Can delay leaf senescence hence prevent yellowing of lettuce leaves after they are picked
		* Used in tissue culture to help promote bud and shoot growth
	* Ethene
		* Speeds up fruit ripening
		* promoting fruit drop in cotton, cherry and walnut
		* promoting female sex expression in cucumbers hence increasing yield by preventing self pollination
		* promoting lateral growth in some plants
		* Preventing ethene production with low temps and low oxygen levels prevents ripening hence fruit can last longer
