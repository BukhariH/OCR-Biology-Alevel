5.4.1 Plant Responses
---

* a) explain why plants need to respond to their environment in terms of the need to avoid predation and abiotic stress;
	* To avoid stress
	* To avoid being eaten	 
	* To survive long enough to reproduce

* b) define the term tropism;
	* Tropism is a direction growth response in which the direction of the response is determined by the direction of the stimuli.
	* These include:
		* Phototropism - shoots growing towards light
		* Geotropism - root growing towards the pull of gravity
		* Chemotropism - pollen tubes grow down the style attracted by chemicals
		* Thigmotropism	 - shoots of climbing plants 

* c) explain how plant responses to environmental changes are co-ordinated by hormones, with reference to responding to changes in light direction;
	*  Auxins stimulate growth by causing cell elongation. 
	* They increase the strictness of the cell wall by promoting active transport of H+ ions by ATPase
	* This provides low pH for the expansions enzymes to loosen the wall
	* The enzymes breakdown bonds within the cellulose which makes the wall less rigid


* d) evaluate the experimental evidence for the role of auxins in the control of apical dominance and gibberellin in the control of stem elongation;
	* Auxins
	
	* Gebrellins
	

* e) outline the role of hormones in leaf loss in deciduous plants;
	* Cytokinins prevent the leaves of deciduous plants from senescing (ageing) by making the leaf a sink for phloem transport
	* Hence when the supply of cytokinins drop that means that there are no longer enough nutrients going to leaves hence they die
	* Usually, Auxins prevent the leafs from abscission by acting on cells in the abscission zone but in senescing:
		* the auxin production on the tip of the leaf falls and ethene production increases
		* this makes the abscission zone more sensitive to ethene
		* Ethene increases the production of cellulase which digests the wall of the cells in the abscission zone
		* eventually the leaves shed

* f) describe how plant hormones are used commercially (HSW6a).
