5.1.2 Meiosis and Variation
---

* a) describe, with the aid of diagrams and photographs, the behaviour of chromosomes during meiosis, and the associated behaviour of the nuclear envelope, cell membrane and centrioles. (Names of the main stages are expected, but not the subdivisions of prophase);
	* Best way to remember mitosis PMAT x2
	* But before that interphase occurs
		* In interphase the DNA replicates so that instead of the 2 chromosomes in the cell, we will now have 4.
	* Meiosis I
		* Prophase I
			* The Chromatin condenses and undergoes supercoiling
			* The chromosomes come together in the homologous pairs to form a bivalent
			* Non sister pairs wrap around each other at points called the charismata
			* Crossing over (exchange of genes) occurs at these points
			* The nucleolus disappears and the nuclear envelope disintegrates 
			* Spindles of protein microtubules form
		* Metaphase I
			* Bivalent pairs line up vertically on the equator
			* Spindles attach at the centromeres
			* Bivalent pairs are arranged randomly (independent assortment)
		* Anaphase I
			* Spindles pull the bivalent apart to opposite parts of the pole
		* Telophase I
			* Two nuclear envelopes form and the cell devices via cytokinesis.
			* In animals there is a Interphase
			* In Plants there in no Telophase
	* Meiosis II
		* Prophase II
			* If there is a nuclear envelope then it brakes down
			* the nucleolus disappears and the chromatids condense
		* Metaphase II
			* Chromosomes arrange themselves horizontally across the equator
			* Spindles form
			* The chromatics are randomly assorted
		* Anaphase II
			* Spindles pull apart the chromosome
		* Telophase II
			* Nucleolus form at each pole
			* Cells divide via cytokinesis
			* In animals 4 haploid cells form
			* In plants a tetrad (2x2 area) forms

* b) explain the terms allele, locus, phenotype, genotype, dominant, codominant and recessive;
	* **allele** - An alternative version of a gene
	* **locus** - A specific position on a chromosome occupied by a specific gene
	* **phenotype** - Observable characteristics of an organism
	* **genotype** - The alleles present within the cells of an individual for a particular trait/characteristic
	* **dominant** - A characteristic that is always expressed in the phenotype even those in heterozygous genotypes
	* **codominant** - A characteristic where both alleles contribute to the phenotype
	* **recessive** - A characteristics that only expressed in the phenotype when there is no dominant allele

* c) explain the terms linkage and crossing-over;
	* **linkage** - Gene's for different characteristics that are at different loci on the same chromosome are linked
	* **crossing over** - Where non sister chromatids exchange alleles during prophase 1 of meiosis

* d) explain how meiosis and fertilisation can lead to variation through the independent assortment of alleles;
	*  Meiosis increases genetic variation by:
		* Crossing over during Prophase I
		* Genetic reassortment due to random assortment and segregation of chromosomes in Meiosis I
		* Genetic reassortment due to random assortment and segregation of chromatids in Meiosis II
		* Random Mutations
		* Fertilisation causes variation by combining two genetically un-identical pairs
		

* e) use genetic diagrams to solve problems involving sex linkage and codominance;
	* Best to read the actual pages in the Heinemann Book. The pages are from 124 and 127!

* f) describe the interactions between loci (epistasis). (Production of genetic diagrams is not required);
	* 

* g) predict phenotypic ratios in problems involving epistasis;

* h) use the chi-squared (χ2) test to test the significance of the difference between observed and expected results. (The formula for the chi-squared test will be provided);

* i) describe the differences between continuous and discontinuous variation;

* j) explain the basis of continuous and discontinuous variation by reference to the number of genes which influence the variation;

* k) explain that both genotype and environment contribute to phenotypic variation. (No calculations of heritability will be expected);

* l) explain why variation is essential in selection;

* m) use the Hardy–Weinberg principle to calculate allele frequencies in populations (HSW1);
	*  (p + q)² = p² + 2pq + q² = 1
		* Therefore:
		*  q = 1 - p
	* Makes the following assumptions:
		* The population is very large
		* The mating within the population is random
		* There is no selective advantage for any genotype
		* There is no mutation, migration or genetic drift

* n) explain, with examples, how environmental factors can act as stabilising or evolutionary forces of natural selection;
	* P 140

* o) explain how genetic drift can cause large changes in small populations;
	* Reduces genetic variation and and may reduce the ability of an organism to survive change because there are so few copies of alleles

* p) explain the role of isolating mechanisms in the evolution of new species, with reference to ecological (geographic), seasonal (temporal) and reproductive mechanisms;

* q) explain the significance of the various concepts of the species, with reference to the biological species concept and the phylogenetic (cladistic/evolutionary) species concept (HSW1);

* r) compare and contrast natural selection and artificial selection;

* s) describe how artificial selection has been used to produce the modern dairy cow and to produce bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) (HSW6a, 6b).
