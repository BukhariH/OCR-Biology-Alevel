5.1.2 Meiosis and Variation
---

* a) describe, with the aid of diagrams and photographs, the behaviour of chromosomes during meiosis, and the associated behaviour of the nuclear envelope, cell membrane and centrioles. (Names of the main stages are expected, but not the subdivisions of prophase);
	* Best way to remember mitosis PMAT x2
	* But before that interphase occurs
		* In interphase the DNA replicates so that instead of the 2 chromosomes in the cell, we will now have 4.
	* Meiosis I
		* Prophase I
			* The Chromatin condenses and undergoes supercoiling
			* The chromosomes come together in the homologous pairs to form a bivalent
			* Non sister pairs wrap around each other at points called the charismata
			* Crossing over (exchange of genes) occurs at these points
			* The nucleolus disappears and the nuclear envelope disintegrates 
			* Spindles of protein microtubules form
		* Metaphase I
			* Bivalent pairs line up vertically on the equator
			* Spindles attach at the centromeres
			* Bivalent pairs are arranged randomly (independent assortment)
		* Anaphase I
			* Spindles pull the bivalent apart to opposite parts of the pole
		* Telophase I
			* Two nuclear envelopes form and the cell devices via cytokinesis.
			* In animals there is a Interphase
			* In Plants there in no Telophase
	* Meiosis II
		* Prophase II
			* If there is a nuclear envelope then it brakes down
			* the nucleolus disappears and the chromatids condense
		* Metaphase II
			* Chromosomes arrange themselves horizontally across the equator
			* Spindles form
			* The chromatics are randomly assorted
		* Anaphase II
			* Spindles pull apart the chromosome
		* Telophase II
			* Nucleolus form at each pole
			* Cells divide via cytokinesis
			* In animals 4 haploid cells form
			* In plants a tetrad (2x2 area) forms

* b) explain the terms allele, locus, phenotype, genotype, dominant, codominant and recessive;
	* **allele** - An alternative version of a gene
	* **locus** - A specific position on a chromosome occupied by a specific gene
	* **phenotype** - Observable characteristics of an organism
	* **genotype** - The alleles present within the cells of an individual for a particular trait/characteristic
	* **dominant** - A characteristic that is always expressed in the phenotype even those in heterozygous genotypes
	* **codominant** - A characteristic where both alleles contribute to the phenotype
	* **recessive** - A characteristics that only expressed in the phenotype when there is no dominant allele

* c) explain the terms linkage and crossing-over;
	* **linkage** - Gene's for different characteristics that are at different loci on the same chromosome are linked
	* **crossing over** - Where non sister chromatids exchange alleles during prophase 1 of meiosis

* d) explain how meiosis and fertilisation can lead to variation through the independent assortment of alleles;
	*  Meiosis increases genetic variation by:
		* Crossing over during Prophase I
		* Genetic reassortment due to random assortment and segregation of chromosomes in Meiosis I
		* Genetic reassortment due to random assortment and segregation of chromatids in Meiosis II
		* Random Mutations
		* Fertilisation causes variation by combining two genetically un-identical pairs
		

* e) use genetic diagrams to solve problems involving sex linkage and codominance;
	* Best to read the actual pages in the Heinemann Book. The pages are from 124 and 127!

* f) describe the interactions between loci (epistasis). (Production of genetic diagrams is not required);

* g) predict phenotypic ratios in problems involving epistasis;

* h) use the chi-squared (χ2) test to test the significance of the difference between observed and expected results. (The formula for the chi-squared test will be provided);

* i) describe the differences between continuous and discontinuous variation;
	* Continuous
		* Describes the quantitative differences in between phenotypes.
		* Where phenotypic differences show a range of variation that can't be put into categories
	* Discontinuous
		* Describes qualitative differences between phenotypes.
		* The variation produced can be easily put into categories.

* j) explain the basis of continuous and discontinuous variation by reference to the number of genes which influence the variation;
	* Continuous 
		* controlled by two or more genes
		* each gene provides an adaptive component to the phenotype
		* different alleles at each gene locus have a small effect on the phenotype
		* a large number of different genes may have a combined effect on the phenotype. These are called polygenes and their effect is called polygenic. The genes are unlinked (on different chromosomes)
	* Discontinuous 
		* different alleles at the same gene locus have a large effect on the phenotype
		* different gene loci can have a large effect on the phenotype
		* examples include codominance, dominance and recessive patterns of inheritance

* k) explain that both genotype and environment contribute to phenotypic variation. (No calculations of heritability will be expected);
	* Genes can give the potential for the characteristic to occur however the environment largely determines the outcome because if the animal say doesn't get enough nutrients to grow then they won't grow regardless of the what the gene says.
	* This effects polygenes more than mono genes.

* l) explain why variation is essential in selection;
	* Genetic variation is a requirement of selection because in order for any type of selection to work there must be organisms with different phenotypes which can then be selected and promoted.

* m) use the Hardy–Weinberg principle to calculate allele frequencies in populations (HSW1);
	*  (p + q)² = p² + 2pq + q² = 1
		* Therefore:
		*  q = 1 - p
	* Makes the following assumptions:
		* The population is very large
		* The mating within the population is random
		* There is no selective advantage for any genotype
		* There is no mutation, migration or genetic drift

* n) explain, with examples, how environmental factors can act as stabilising or evolutionary forces of natural selection;
	* If the environment remains stable then so does the selection pressure hence any variation won't likely give an advantage to the organism and may even be destructive for the organism. 
	* This prevents those genes from being passed on.
	* However, of the environment changes and produces a new selection pressure then the organisms best suited to the environment will be able to live long enough to reproduce to pass on their genes.

* o) explain how genetic drift can cause large changes in small populations;
	* Reduces genetic variation and may reduce the ability of an organism to survive change because there are so few copies of alleles

* p) explain the role of isolating mechanisms in the evolution of new species, with reference to ecological (geographic), seasonal (temporal) and reproductive mechanisms;
	* Geographic barriers and seasonal barriers will cause allopatric speciation
	* reproductive mechanism that are incompatible will cause sympatric speciation

* q) explain the significance of the various concepts of the species, with reference to the biological species concept and the phylogenetic (cladistic/evolutionary) species concept (HSW1);
	* Biological species concept
		* A group of similar organisms that can breed together to produce offspring that are fertile.
	* Phylogenetic species concept  
		* A group of organisms that have the same morphology, physiology, embryology, behaviour and occupy the same ecological niche. 

* r) compare and contrast natural selection and artificial selection;
	* In natural selection those who are best adapted will survive long enough to pass their genes on to their offspring.
		* The environment is doing the selecting
	* In artificial selection humans are doing the selecting. 
	* The genetic process underlying both in exactly the same

* s) describe how artificial selection has been used to produce the modern dairy cow and to produce bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) (HSW6a, 6b).
	* Diary Cow
		* Each cows milk is measured
		* The offspring are tested to find out which bull produced the highest yield
		* You only need a few bulls since their semen can be taken and we can use artificial fertilisation
		* Some elite cows are given hormones to produce eggs
		* In vitro fertilisation and then embryos planted in to mother
		* These embryos are cloned and divided into many more embryos 
		* Hence, a few elite cows can produce a lot of offspring
	* Wheat
		* Their nuclei can contain more chromosomes in the nucleus than the one diploid set
		* Hence, as the numbers of chromosomes increases so does the nuclei and hence the cell size increases
