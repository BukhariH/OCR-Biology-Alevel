5.3.1 Ecosystems
---

* a) define the term ecosystem;
	* Any group of living organisms and non-living things and the interrelationships between them can be called an ecosystem. 
	* The components of an ecosystem are:
		* Habitat - the place where an organism lives
		* Population - all of the organisms of one species, who live in the same place and the same time and can breed together
		* Environment - all the populations of different species who live in the same place, at the same time and can interact between each other
	* The role that each species plays in an ecosystem is called a niche.

* b) state that ecosystems are dynamic systems;
	* Population sizes increase and fall due to interactions between species.
	* For example:
		* If the population of a predator increases then the population of the prey decreases but this will also cause a decrease in the population of the predators as there is more competition for a lesser amount of prey. Then the lower amount of predators would cause an increase in the population of the prey.
		* In soil with low nitrogen levels; nitrogen fixing plants would grow successfully, however they will cause higher levels of nitrogen in the soil hence allowing other plants to grow.
	

* c) define the terms biotic factor and abiotic factor, using named examples;
	* Biotic Factors - the living components of an ecosystem
		* food supply
		* predation
		* disease
	* Abiotic Factors - the non-living components of an ecosystem
		* pH
		* Temperature
		* Soil Type

* d) define the terms producer, consumer, decomposer and trophic level;
	* Producers
		* Autotrophic organisms that convert light energy to chemical energy 
	* Consumers
		* Living organisms that feed on other living organisms
	* Decomposers
		* Feed on dead organic materials releasing molecules, minerals and energy for other organisms into the ecosystem to use
	* Trophic Level
		* The level at which an organism feeds in a food chain

* e) describe how energy is transferred though ecosystems;
	*  Energy is transferred as different organisms consume each other

* f) outline how energy transfers between trophic levels can be measured;
	* Pyramids of Biomass
		* The area of the bars represent the dry mass of the organisms
			* Animals need to be killed and heated to 80°C to evaporate all the water
			* Then they are weighed
		* This method is quite destructive so usually the wet mass is counted and then they refer to pre-existing data to calculate the dry mass
	* Pyramids of Energy
		* Different organisms release different amounts of energy per unit mass
		* They burn the animal in a calorimeter and work out how much heat is stored per gram 
			* worked out using Q = MCΔT for those of you doing chemistry
		* This is far to time consuming usually and they only provide a snapshot of an ecosystem
			* because population sizes fluctuate this may provide a distorted view
	* Productivity
		* Productivity is the rate of energy flow through each trophic level
		* Gives us an indication of how much energy is available to an organism at each trophic level
		* At the start of the food chain it is referred to as primary productivity
			* There are two types of primary productivity:
				 * Gross primary productivity is the amount of light energy converted to chemical energy
				 * Net primary productivity is the Gross primary productivity minus all the energy need by the plant to carry out life processes

* g) discuss the efficiency of energy transfers between trophic levels;
	* At each trophic level some energy is lost:
		* At each trophic level organisms need energy to carry out life processes
			* They carry out respiration to release energy from organic molecules
		* Some energy is trapped in dead organisms and waste hence is only available to decomposers 
	* Because of this less energy is available higher up the food chain hence less tissue is supported. Hence, we tend to have lower population numbers higher up the food chain.

* h) explain how human activities can manipulate the flow of energy through ecosystems (HSW6b);
	* Improving Primary Production:

	| Factor       | Effect          | Solution |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Low light levels | limits rate of photosynthesis| plant earlier for longer growing season and grow under light banks |
| Lack of water | needed for photosynthesis | drought resistant strains of plants |
| Low temps | limits speed of chemical reactions | planting field crops earlier |
| Lack of nutrients | limits rte of photosynthesis | crop rotation & including nitrogen fixing plants |
| Pests | Eat crops hence lower yield | Pesticides and GM pest resistant crops |
| Fungal diseases | cause root rot | fungicides and GM fungus resistant crops |
| Interspecific Competition | less light, water and nutrients available to crops | use herbicides |

	* Secondary productivity is the transfer of energy from producers to consumers
	* Improving Secondary productivity
		* Harvesting animals just before adulthood
		* Selective breeding
		* Use of antibiotics
		* Preventing movement
		* Constant temps
		

* i) describe one example of primary succession resulting in a climax community;
	* Succession is the directional change in a community of organisms over time. 
	* Primary succession:
		* Development of a community from bare ground.
		* Example:
			* Surtsey is an island that was created by a volcanic eruption.
			* Algae and Lichens started to grow on the land
			* When the died and started to decompose; they provided enough land for larger plants like mosses and ferns to succeed.
			* When these died they provided more soil for larger plants and this continued till it reached a climax community.
			* In Britain, usually, climax communities tend to be woodland.
	* Secondary succession:
		* Where is a previously colonised habitat is disrupted or damaged.
	* Succession on sand dunes
		* Sand dunes display all the stages of succession in the same place & at the same time
		* The sand at sea level is just starting in the process of succession whilst sand further away might have already reached a climax community.
	* Pioneer plants like sea rocket and prickly sandwort colonise the sand just above sea level
	* Wind flown sand build up around the bases hence forming a mini sand dune
	* As plants die nutrient accumulate in the sand dunes allow sea sandworts and sea couch grass to colonise the dunes.
	* The sea couch grass has large roots which stabilise the dunes 
	* Because of the increases stability and increased nutrients plants like sea spurge and Marram grass colonise the dunes.
	* Marram grass is special because as the shoots grow they trap wind blown grass hence the shoots grow to stay above the dunes causing more sand to become trapped.
	* As the stability and the nutrients increases; legumes like hare's foot and bird's foot colonise the sand dunes and fix nitrogen from the air into the plants
	* Now that nitrogen is available more plants can colonise the sand dunes 

* j) describe how the distribution and abundance of organisms can be measured, using line transects, belt transects, quadrats and point quadrats (HSW3);
	* Transects
		* Allows you to systematically look at changes in venation across a habitat
		* line transects
			* At regular intervals, take note of the species touching the tape
		* belt transects
			* At regular intervals, place a quadrat at a point and then do as shown below
	* quadrats
		* You can record three things:
			* Distribution - record whether a species is present or not
			* Abundance - the number of individuals present or absent in the area
			* Percentage Cover - the area covered by the species
		* point quadrats:
			* Point quadrants help us correctly record percentage cover
			* You stand the point quadrat
			* Record the species that the needle touches on the way down
		* To avoid bias:
			* Randomly position the quadrat
			* take samples at regular distances
		* To work out the number of quadrats need ecologists carry out a pilot study
			* Then record a cumulative frequency table
			* Find when it plateaus
			* Usually double this number
			* You can do the same thing for the size of the quadrat
		* Population Size = ( mean number of individuals of the species in each quadrant) / ( fraction of the total habitat covered by a quadrat )

* k) describe the role of decomposers in the decomposition of organic material;
	* Decomposers tend to be bacteria and fungi.
	* These are known as saprotrophs as they excrete enzymes of dead organic matter
	* the enzymes breakdown the matter
	* the bacteria/fungi absorb the molecules and then either store them or respire using them
	* Crucial to ecosystems as they release trapped energy from waste and dead organic matter.
	* Also play important roles in carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle

* l) describe how microorganisms recycle nitrogen within ecosystems. (Only Nitrosomonas, Nitrobacter and Rhizobium need to be identified by name).
	* Nitrosomonas - Oxidise Ammonium (NH₄) into Nitrite (NO₂) 
		* Require aerobic conditions because they need oxygen for oxidation
	* Nitrobacter - Oxidise Nitrite (NO₂) into Nitrate (NO₃) 
		* Require aerobic conditions because they need oxygen for oxidation 
	* Rhizobium - Fixes nitrogen from air into soil
		* Live inside root nodules
			* Mutalistic relation with the plant where the plant provides glucose in exchange for Nitrogen.
			* Proteins (leghaemoglobin) in nodules absorb oxygen to force anaerobic respiration in the bacterium
			* In anaerobic conditions nitrogen reductase, reduces nitrogen gas to ammonia.
