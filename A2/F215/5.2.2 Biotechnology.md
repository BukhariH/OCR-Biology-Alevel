5.2.2 Biotechnology
---

* a) state that biotechnology is the industrial use of living organisms (or parts of living organisms) to produce food, drugs or other products (HSW6a);
	* The technology based upon the exploitation of living organisms or biological process
		* This is to improve agriculture, animal husbandry, food science, medicines and industry.

* b) explain why microorganisms are often used in biotechnological processes;
	* they grow rapidly in optimal conditions
	* produce and release proteins or chemicals into the surrounding environment which can be harvested
	* can be genetically engineered to produce specific products
	* grow well at low temperatures
	* can be grown around the world
	* then to generate pure products
	* often can be grown using waste products as nutrients

* c) describe, with the aid of diagrams, and explain the standard growth curve of a microorganism in a closed culture;
	* Consists of 4 phases:
		* Lag phase - this is the phase where the micro-organism are getting accustomed to the environment around them.
			* Such as:
				* Taking up water
				* Cell expansion
				* Activating specific genes
				* Synthesising a specific enzyme
			* Example of this would be what we learnt about the lac operon. Where are gene is activated by a substrate to produce an enzyme to break down the substrate
		* Log phase -  this is the phase with exponential growth where nutrients, space and waste are not limiting
		* Stationary Phase -  this the phase where nutrients, space or waste starts becoming limiting (in an open system this is called the carrying capacity)
			* Birth Rate = Death Rate
		* Death phase - this is the phase during which we see a massive decline in birth of new organisms because nutrients, space or waste have become limiting.

* d) describe how enzymes can be immobilised;
	* Binded to a support:
		* Adsorption
			* bind due to a combination of hydrophobic interactions & ionic links
				* but the bonding is weak hence enzymes can be detached. This is called **leakage**
			* High rates of reaction as long as the active site isn't disrupted
		* Covalent Bonding
			* molecules covalently bond to a support
			* does not immobilise a large quantity of enzymes
			* binding is very strong hence low leakage
	* Held without binding:
		* Entrapment
			* Trapped in their natural state hence the active site isn't affected
			* reaction rate can be lower as substrate molecules need to get through the barrier
		* Membrane separation
			* physically separated by a partially permeable membrane

* e) explain why immobilised enzymes are used in large-scale production;

| Advantages        | Disadvantages           |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
|	Not present in product hence do not need to be recovered later on | Requires additional time, equipment and money hence is more expensive|
| 	Enzymes available immediately to reuse | Can be less active as they aren't mixing with the substrate freely|
| 	More stable because immobilising protects the enzymes molecules| Any contamination is costly as the whole system needs to be stopped|

* f) compare and contrast the processes of continuous culture and batch culture;

| Batch Culture        | Continuos Culture           |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
|	Slower growth rate as nutrient levels decrease over time | Fast growth rate as nutrient levels are **continuously** replenished|
| 	Easy to setup and maintain | Set up and maintaince are far more difficult|
| 	Only one batch is ever lost to contamination| If contamination occurs huge volumes of product maybe lost|
| 	Less efficient as the fermenter isn't operational 24/7 | More efficient as the fermenter is operational 24/7|
| 	Preferable for secondary metabolites| Preferable for primary metabolites|

* g) describe the differences between primary and secondary metabolites;
	* Primary Metabolites are produced during the Log Phase and are the result of the organism growing.
	* Secondary Metabolites occur in the stationary phase and are the result of pressure on the organism. This is usually because nutrients, space or waste has become limiting. These substances are not a part of normal growth.

* h) explain the importance of manipulating the growing conditions in a fermentation vessel in order to maximise the yield of product required;
	* Growing conditions are picked specifically to be optimal for the microorgaism being used. Conditions controlled are:
		* Temperature - enzymes denature at high temperature
		* pH - reduces enzyme activity
		* Oxygen Concentration - Lack of oxygen may cause aerobic respiration which would produce the wrong products
		* type of nutrients used / when to add nutrients - depends on whether the product is a primary or secondary metabolite

* i) explain the importance of asepsis in the manipulation of microorganisms.
	* The optimal conditions are very similar for most microorganisms hence unwanted organism (contamination) could:
		* Compete with the culture of space and nutrients hence lowering yield
		* Reduce yield of useful products by using them
		* May cause spoilage
		* May produce toxic chemicals
		* May destroy the culture organism and products
