5.4.2 Animal Responses
---

* a) discuss why animals need to respond to their environment;
	* One of the main characteristics of living organisms is that they are able to respond to both internal and external changes.
	* All organisms need a method of communication between their sensors and effectors.
	* Animals need to be able coordinate a vast numbers of responses if they are to escape predation and to live long to to procreate.

* b) outline the organisation of the nervous system in terms of central and peripheral systems in humans;
	* Coordinates the actions of a body through electrical impulses
	* Works in conjunction with the endocrine system
	* It is split up by structure and function
	* Central Nervous System
		* Consists of the brain and spinal cord
		* Made up of grey matter (non-myelinated cells) and white matter (myelinated cells)
	* The Peripheral Nervous System
		* It is made up of thousands of neurones that carry impulses to and from the CNS.
		* Sensory and motor systems of the PNS
			* Sensor neurones carry impulses from receptors to the CNS.
			* Motor neurones carry impulses from the CNS to the effectors.
				* Two types of motor neurones:
					* Somatic - Carry impulses from CNS to skeletal muscles which are voluntary muscles
					* Autonomic - Carry impulses from the CNS to cardiac muscle, smooth muscle in the gut and wall and gland, which are not under voluntary control
			* Many neurones are bundled into connective tissue to form nerves.

* c) outline the organisation and roles of the autonomic nervous system;
	* The autonomic nervous is self governing and responsible for a lot of the homeostatic mechanisms but it can also deal with heightened responses such as stress.
	* Most autonomic neurones are non-myelinated whilst most somatic neurones are myelinated.
	* Autonomic connections to the effectors contain at least two neurones connected at a ganglion.
	* Two types of autonomic neurones.
		* Sympathetic
		* Parasympathetic
	* These are both antagonistic as the action of the neurones is directly opposite to the action of the other.

| Parasympathetic        | Sympathetic           |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| Relaxation Pathway | Stress Pathway (Best way to remember is that Sympathetic and Stress both start with an S) |
| Linked with a ganglion within the target tissue hence vary in length | linked at a ganglion out the spinal cord hence very short. (Best way to remember is that Sympathetic and Short both start with an S) |
| Effects include decreased heart rate, pupil contrition, decreased ventilation, and sexual arousal | increased heart rate, pupil dilation, increased ventilation, and orgasm |


* d) describe, with the aid of diagrams, the gross structure of the human brain, and outline the functions of the cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata and hypothalamus; [![YouTube Icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/1f3r3D191I2T0N3g3333/favicon-vfldLzJxy.ico)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMKc8nfPATI)
	* Cerebrum
		* Controls higher functions such as conscious thought, override relaxes, features associated with intelligence
		* e.g. reasoning and judgement
		* Divided into:
			* Sensory areas - receives impulses indirectly from receptors
			* Association areas - Compare input with previous experience
			* Motor areas - sends impulses to effectors
	* Cerebellum
		* Controls the coordination of movement, balance, fine movement and posture
		* Carry impulses from motor areas so that motor output to the effectors can be adjusted appropriately
		* Contains over half of all the nerve cells in the brain
	* Medulla oblongata
		* Controls non-skeletal muscles which means it is effectively in charge of the autonomic system
		* e.g.  breathing, heart rate and digestion
	* Hypothalamus
		* Controls the homeostatic mechanisms
		* Controls much of the bodies endocrine functions as it controls the pituitary gland
		* e.g. body temperature and blood water potential


* e) describe the role of the brain and nervous system in the co-ordination of muscular movement;
	* The conscious decision to move voluptuary muscles starts at the cerebrum but the fine control of movement requires a lot of non-conscious operation which occurs at the cerebellum
		* For example:
			* maintaining posture
			* judging the position of an object/limb
			* tensioning of muscles in order to manipulate tools/instruments effectively
			* feedback on muscle position, tension and fine movements
	* Neurones from the cerebellum carry impulses to the motor areas so that the motor output can be adjusted according to the above factors
	* The cerebellum process sensory information from:		* the retina
		* balance organs in the ear
		* muscle spindles which give information about muscle tension
		* the joints
	

* f) describe how co-ordinated movement requires the action of skeletal muscles about joints, with reference to the movement of the elbow joint;
	*  Voluntary muscles are attached to the bone by tendons such that the contraction of the muscles cause the bone to move at the joints
		* Tendons are made from tough, inelastic collagen which is continuos with the muscle and the periosteum
	* Ligaments hold bones together to prevent dislocation
	* Muscles only capable of producing force when the contract
	* Hence, movements must be coordinated by at least two muscles
	 	* As one is stimulated and contracts then other must relax
	 * Muscles working in pairs opposite each other are called antagonistic 
	 * Movement of muscles at many joints requires a wider range of actions under control of groups of muscles called synergists
	 * The elbow
	 	* It is an example of a synovial joints because it needs a large range of movement
	 		* Synovial fluid is lubricant 
	 		* The biceps and triceps move agnostically to move the forearm at the elbow

* g) explain, with the aid of diagrams and photographs, the sliding filament model of muscular contraction; [![YouTube Icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/1f3r3D191I2T0N3g3333/favicon-vfldLzJxy.ico)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mejCXr7p37U)

* h) outline the role of ATP in muscular contraction, and how the supply of ATP is maintained in muscles;

* i) compare and contrast the action of synapses and neuromuscular junctions;
	* Neuromuscular Junctions
		* Impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction cause the vesicles to fuse with the pre-synaptic membrane releasing acetylcholine  in to the cleft

* j) outline the structural and functional differences between voluntary, involuntary and cardiac muscle;

* k) state that responses to environmental stimuli in mammals are co-ordinated by nervous and endocrine systems;

* l) explain how, in mammals, the 'fight or flight' response to environmental stimuli is co-ordinated by the nervous and endocrine systems.
