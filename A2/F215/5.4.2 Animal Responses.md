5.4.2 Animal Responses
---

* a) discuss why animals need to respond to their environment;
	* One of the main characteristics of living organisms is that they are able to respond to both internal and external changes.
	* All organisms need a method of communication between their sensors and effectors.
	* Animals need to be able coordinate a vast numbers of responses if they are to escape predation and to live long to to procreate.

* b) outline the organisation of the nervous system in terms of central and peripheral systems in humans;
	* Coordinates the actions of a body through electrical impulses
	* Works in conjunction with the endocrine system
	* It is split up by structure and function
	* Central Nervous System
		* Consists of the brain and spinal cord
		* Made up of grey matter (non-myelinated cells) and white matter (myelinated cells)
	* The Peripheral Nervous System
		* It is made up of thousands of neurones that carry impulses to and from the CNS.
		* Sensory and motor systems of the PNS
			* Sensor neurones carry impulses from receptors to the CNS.
			* Motor neurones carry impulses from the CNS to the effectors.
				* Two types of motor neurones:
					* Somatic - Carry impulses from CNS to skeletal muscles which are voluntary muscles
					* Autonomic - Carry impulses from the CNS to cardiac muscle, smooth muscle in the gut and wall and gland, which are not under voluntary control
			* Many neurones are bundled into connective tissue to form nerves.

* c) outline the organisation and roles of the autonomic nervous system;
	* The autonomic nervous is self governing and responsible for a lot of the homeostatic mechanisms but it can also deal with heightened responses such as stress.
	* Most autonomic neurones are non-myelinated whilst most somatic neurones are myelinated.
	* Autonomic connections to the effectors contain at least two neurones connected at a ganglion.
	* Two types of autonomic neurones.
		* Sympathetic
		* Parasympathetic
	* These are both antagonistic as the action of the neurones is directly opposite to the action of the other.

| Parasympathetic        | Sympathetic           |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| Relaxation Pathway | Stress Pathway (Best way to remember is that Sympathetic and Stress both start with an S) |
| Linked with a ganglion within the target tissue hence vary in length | linked at a ganglion out the spinal cord hence very short. (Best way to remember is that Sympathetic and Short both start with an S) |
| Effects include decreased heart rate, pupil contrition, decreased ventilation, and sexual arousal | increased heart rate, pupil dilation, increased ventilation, and orgasm |


* d) describe, with the aid of diagrams, the gross structure of the human brain, and outline the functions of the cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata and hypothalamus; [![YouTube Icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/1f3r3D191I2T0N3g3333/favicon-vfldLzJxy.ico)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMKc8nfPATI)
	* Cerebrum
		* Controls higher functions such as conscious thought, override relaxes, features associated with intelligence
		* e.g. reasoning and judgement
		* Divided into:
			* Sensory areas - receives impulses indirectly from receptors
			* Association areas - Compare input with previous experience
			* Motor areas - sends impulses to effectors
	* Cerebellum
		* Controls the coordination of movement, balance, fine movement and posture
		* Carry impulses from motor areas so that motor output to the effectors can be adjusted appropriately
		* Contains over half of all the nerve cells in the brain
	* Medulla oblongata
		* Controls non-skeletal muscles which means it is effectively in charge of the autonomic system
		* e.g.  breathing, heart rate and digestion
	* Hypothalamus
		* Controls the homeostatic mechanisms
		* Controls much of the bodies endocrine functions as it controls the pituitary gland
		* e.g. body temperature and blood water potential


* e) describe the role of the brain and nervous system in the co-ordination of muscular movement;
	* The conscious decision to move voluptuary muscles starts at the cerebrum but the fine control of movement requires a lot of non-conscious operation which occurs at the cerebellum
		* For example:
			* maintaining posture
			* judging the position of an object/limb
			* tensioning of muscles in order to manipulate tools/instruments effectively
			* feedback on muscle position, tension and fine movements
	* Neurones from the cerebellum carry impulses to the motor areas so that the motor output can be adjusted according to the above factors
	* The cerebellum process sensory information from:		* the retina
		* balance organs in the ear
		* muscle spindles which give information about muscle tension
		* the joints


* f) describe how co-ordinated movement requires the action of skeletal muscles about joints, with reference to the movement of the elbow joint;
	*  Voluntary muscles are attached to the bone by tendons such that the contraction of the muscles cause the bone to move at the joints
		* Tendons are made from tough, inelastic collagen which is continuos with the muscle and the periosteum
	* Ligaments hold bones together to prevent dislocation
	* Muscles only capable of producing force when the contract
	* Hence, movements must be coordinated by at least two muscles
	 	* As one is stimulated and contracts then other must relax
	 * Muscles working in pairs opposite each other are called antagonistic
	 * Movement of muscles at many joints requires a wider range of actions under control of groups of muscles called synergists
	 * The elbow
	 	* It is an example of a synovial joints because it needs a large range of movement
	 		* Synovial fluid is lubricant
	 		* The biceps and triceps move agnostically to move the forearm at the elbow

* g) explain, with the aid of diagrams and photographs, the sliding filament model of muscular contraction; [![YouTube Icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/1f3r3D191I2T0N3g3333/favicon-vfldLzJxy.ico)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mejCXr7p37U)
	* The Sarcomere
		* The span from one Z line to another Z line is called a sarcomere
			* Z lines are closer when the muscle contracts
		* The I band stretches from one thick filament to the next
			* The I band reduces in size when the muscle contracts
		* H zone stretches between the thin filaments
			* Reduces in size when muscle contracts
		* A band is the size of the thick filament
			* Does not change in size
	* Thin filament structure
		* Thin filaments are two strands of F actin (fibrous protein) coiled around each other.
		* Each F actin strand is composed of G actin (globular protein) subunits
		* Tropomyosin molecules coil around the F actin preventing access to the G actin subunits
		* Each tropomyosin is attached to a Troponin subunit
		* The subunit has three polypeptides:
			* One for tropomyosin
			* One for actin
			* One for Ca²⁺ ions
	* Thick filament structure
		* Thick filaments are essentially myosin proteins
		* Each has a tail and a head
		* Each filament consists of many myosin molecules whose heads stick out on opposite ends
	* Power Stroke
		* Myosin head attaches to actin forming a cross bridge
		* Hydrolysis of ATP releases energy, ADP and Pᵢ
		* The head group bends back causing the filament to be pulled back
			* This is called the power stroke
		* A new ATP molecule attaches to the myosin head causing the cross bridge to brake
		* Hydrolysis of ATP releases energy, ADP and Pᵢ
		* The head group moves back to origin position
		* Now it can attach to another actin molecule
	* The role of Ca²⁺ ions
		* The tropomyosin hides the active site for the myosin heads to attach with ATP at
		* Hence, Ca²⁺ ions bind the the troponin which causes the shape of troponin to change and pulls tropomyosin away
		* Now, tropomyosin is no longer blocking the myosin so the cross bridge can form
	* Relaxation
		* When the muscle needs to relax, carrier proteins actively transport the Ca²⁺ ions back into the Sarcoplasmic reticulum

* h) outline the role of ATP in muscular contraction, and how the supply of ATP is maintained in muscles;
	* When the cross bridge is formed, the myosin heads are in their most stable position hence ATP is need to pull them back
	* There is only ATP for 1-2 seconds of contraction
	* Supply is maintained by:
		* Aerobic respiration in muscle cell mitochondria
		* Anaerobic respiration is the cell sarcoplasm
			* However, toxic lactic acid is produced which triggers increased blood flow
		* Transfer of creatine phosphate in the cell sarcoplasm where the phosphate group from the creatine phosphate is used to produce ATP from ADP by creatine phosphotransferase
		* There enough creatine phosphate for 2-4 seconds of extra contraction

* i) compare and contrast the action of synapses and neuromuscular junctions;
	* Motor neurones connect to muscles at the neuromuscular junctions
	* Neuromuscular Junctions
		* Impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction cause the vesicles to fuse with the pre-synaptic membrane releasing acetylcholine in to the cleft
		* Acetylcholine binds to the receptors on the muscle fibre membrane (sarcolemma) causing depolarisation
		* Depolarisation travels down the tubules (T system)
		* Ca²⁺ ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
		* Ca²⁺ binds to muscle proteins which leads to contraction
	* The brain controls the strength of contraction because many motor neurones stimulate one muscle.
	* Each motor neurone is connected at a neuromuscular junction and this together is called a motor unit
	* The more motor units that are stimulated; the greater force of contraction
		* this is know as graduation of response
	* Increasing the strength of a stimuli increases the strength of the contraction
	* Increasing the frequency of the stimuli causes summation where a more powerful contraction occurs
	* Increasing the strength and the frequency gives a sustained and powerful contraction


* j) outline the structural and functional differences between voluntary, involuntary and cardiac muscle;
	* Involuntary (smooth) muscle
		* As the name suggest these muscles are not under conscious control as the neurones are connected to the Autonomic Nervous system
		* | Location        | Arrangement of muscle cells | Action           |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|:-------------:
| Walls of intestine | Circular and longitudinal bundles | Peristalsis - moves food along intestine |
| Iris of the eye | Circular and radial bundles | Contraction of radial muscle dilates the pupil. Contraction of the circular muscle constricts the pupil. |
| Wall of arteries and around the arterioles. wall and cervix of uterus | circular bundles | Contraction of muscles narrows the blood vessel diameter reducing blood flow; relaxation causes dilation |

		* The muscles cells are referred to as being spindle-shaped
		* Contain small bundles of actin and myosin
		* 500µm long and 5µm wide and have a single nucleus
		* Contraction is very slow but the muscle also tires very slow

	* Cardiac muscle
		* Three types:
			* Atrial muscle
			* Ventricular muscle
			* Specialised excitatory and conductive muscle fibres
		* Atrial and ventricular contract similar to striated muscle
		* The excitatory and conductive fibres conduct feebly but conduct electrical impulses and control the heart beat
		* Some muscle fibres can contract without nerve impulses - these are called myogenic
		* Neurones from the Autonomic nervous system control the rate of contraction
		* The sinoatrial node (SAN) is made up of specialised excitatory and conductive fibres hence has the greatest ability for self excitation
		* The impulse immediately travels down to the Atrioventricular node (AVN).
		* The AVN conducts the electrical impulse to the ventricular tips via the Purkyne fibres
		* Made up of many connected cells whose membranes have fused hence there are gap junctions with free diffusions ions so action potentials pass very easily and quickly
		* Muscle contracts powerfully and without fatigue

	* Voluntary (striated/skeletal) muscle
		* Movement of bones at joints
		* Muscle cells form fibres 100µm in diameter with multiple nuclei
		* Each fibre is surrounded by a cell surface membrane called a sarcolemma
		* Muscle cell cytoplasm is called sarcoplasm
			* Contains many organelles:
				* many mitochondria
				* an extensive number of sarcoplasmic reticulum
				* a number of myofibrils
		* Muscle contracts quickly and powerfully but fatigues quickly aswell


* k) state that responses to environmental stimuli in mammals are co-ordinated by nervous and endocrine systems;
	* The brain regulates a number of endocrine responses from it's control of the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus

* l) explain how, in mammals, the 'fight or flight' response to environmental stimuli is co-ordinated by the nervous and endocrine systems. [![YouTube Icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/1f3r3D191I2T0N3g3333/favicon-vfldLzJxy.ico)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2GywoS77qc)
	* Coordination:
		* The understanding of the threat by the cerebral cortex triggers the hypothalamus
		* The hypothalamus triggers the sympathetic nervous system and triggers the release of adrenaline from the adrenal medulla
		* The hypothalamus also releases CRF into the pituitary gland which releases ACTH
		* ACTH causes a number of different hormones to be released from adrenal cortex
		* Some of these hormones help the body resist stressors
	* Physiological changes
		* Pupils dilates
		* Heart rate a blood pressure increases
		* Arterioles to the digestive system constrict
		* Arterioles to the muscles and liver dilate
		* Blood glucose level increases
		* Metabolic rate increases
		* Erector pili muscles in the skin contract making the hairs stand up
		* Ventilation rate increases
		* Endorphins are released
		* Sweat production increases
