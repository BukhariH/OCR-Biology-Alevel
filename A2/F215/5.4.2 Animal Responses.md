5.4.2 Animal Responses
---

* a) discuss why animals need to respond to their environment;

* b) outline the organisation of the nervous system in terms of central and peripheral systems in humans;

* c) outline the organisation and roles of the autonomic nervous system;

* d) describe, with the aid of diagrams, the gross structure of the human brain, and outline the functions of the cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata and hypothalamus;

* e) describe the role of the brain and nervous system in the co-ordination of muscular movement;

* f) describe how co-ordinated movement requires the action of skeletal muscles about joints, with reference to the movement of the elbow joint;

* g) explain, with the aid of diagrams and photographs, the sliding filament model of muscular contraction;

* h) outline the role of ATP in muscular contraction, and how the supply of ATP is maintained in muscles;

* i) compare and contrast the action of synapses and neuromuscular junctions;

* j) outline the structural and functional differences between voluntary, involuntary and cardiac muscle;

* k) state that responses to environmental stimuli in mammals are co-ordinated by nervous and endocrine systems;

* l) explain how, in mammals, the 'fight or flight' response to enviromnetal stimuli is co-ordinated by the nervous and endocrine systems.
