4.1.1 Communication
---

* a) outline the need for communication systems within multicellular organisms, with reference to the need to respond to changes in the internal and external environment and to co-ordinate the activities of different organs;
	* All organisms need to maintain a set of conditions (for enzymes) such as:
		* pH
		* Temperature
		* an aqueous environment
		* no toxins or inhibitors
	* The environment around us is extremely dynamic hence our body needs a way of communication in order to
	maintain the requirements listed above.
	* This is the Stimulus -> Response cycle. Where a stimulus such as temperature causes a response such as the arctic fox's changing coat colour.
	* In order to control the environment of cells there is almost always a protective layer of cells surrounding the tissue such as epithelial tissue in animals. The tissue is also usually soaked in tissue fluid which forms the environment around the cell.
		* Respiring cells release CO₂ which causes the tissue fluid to become more acidic which can cause enzymes to denature hence animals have receptors which detect change in pH as a stimuli which causes a response such as an increased breathing rate.
		* Tissue fluid is mainly composed of blood which transports substances to and from cells and prevents accumulation of toxins.
	* Multicellular organisms are far more efficient when compared to single cell organisms as cells can differentiate and specialise to make tissues and organisms however this means a cell responsible for the stimuli and a cell responsible for
	response to a stimuli can be very far away. Hence the need for an effective cell signalling solution.
	* A good solution will:
		* cover the whole body
		* allow for both specific & rapid cell communication.
		* allow for long & short term response
	
	
* b) state that cells need to communicate with each other by a process called cell signalling;
	* Cells communicate by a process called **Cell Signalling**.
		* In this system a chemical released by cell is detected by another cell which then responds.

* c) state that neuronal and hormonal systems are examples of cell signalling;
	* There are two major communication systems in our body: Neuronal & Hormonal.
		* The neuronal system is responsible for short term responses as it utilises neurones to carry electrical signals extremely fast across synapses to other neurones which allow a response to be made.
		* The hormonal system relies on cells releasing hormones which are carried in either the blood or ducts and are detected
		by cells which have receptors that can bind to the cell. The hormonal system is used for long term responses.

* d) define the terms negative feedback, positive feedback and homeostasis;
	* *negative feedback* is a process which reverses any change in conditions. It ensures that an optimum environment can be maintained such as maintaining CO₂ levels.
	* *positive feedback* is a process which increases any change by a magnitude such as the release of oxytocin in child birth
	which increases contractions.
	* *homeostasis* is the maintenance of a constant environment despite external changes.
	 
* e) explain the principles of homeostasis in terms of receptors, effectors and negative feedback;
	* Many conditions have to controlled such as:
		* blood temperature
		* blood glucose concentration
		* blood salt concentration
		* water potential of blood
		* blood pressure
		* CO₂ concentration

		 * The negative feedback path way is:
		 stimuli -> receptor -> cell signalling (both hormonal and neuronal) -> effector (cell in charge of forming a response)
		 -> response
		 	* Sensory receptors detect stimuli
		 	* communication system such as hormonal and neuronal signal cells
		 	* effector cells such as liver and muscle cells build a response


* f) describe the physiological and behavioural responses that maintain a constant core body temperature in ectotherms and endotherms, with reference to peripheral temperature receptors, the hypothalamus and effectors in skin and muscles.
	* *Ectotherms*
		* They rely on external temperature to regulate their body temperature. Except for in extreme circumstances ectotherms are usually able to manage well.
		* *Advantages*
			* Less food used for respiration hence they need to find less food
			* A greater proportion of their energy can be used on growth
		* *Disadvantages*
			* Less active in cooler temperatures hence at great risk of predation and also need to the day of by basking in the sun.
			* Aren't capable of activity during winter hence need large food stores.
		* *Regulation*
		* Ectotherms don’t use internal energy sources to maintain heat however once they are active their muscles do generate some heat.
		* Their temperature regulation relies on increasing or decreasing heat exchange and they do this by chaining their behaviour or physiology.
			* *Behavior Adaptions*

				| Adaptions        | How it helps           | Example  |
				| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:|
				| Expose body to heat      | Enables more heat to absorbed | Snakes |
				| Orientate body to/away from the sun     | Exposes larger/less surface for heat      |   Locusts |
				| Hide in burrows | Reduces heat absorbtion  |   Lizards  |
				| Alter body shape | expose less or more surface area to the sun  |   Horned Lizards  |
				| Increased breathing movements | Evaporates more water  |   Locusts  |

	* *Endotherms*
		* Endotherms use internal sources of heat to help maintain their body temperature. This is because many metabolic reactions are exogenic and endotherms have the ability to increase respiration via the liver to increase the heat produced.
		* *Advantages*
			* a constant temperature regardless of the environment
			* active even in times of low temperatures
			* ability to inhabit colder environments
		* *Disadvantages*
			* significant amount of energy used to maintain body temperature
			* more food required
			* less energy used for growth
		* *Regulation*
			* *Physiological Adaptions*

				| Component of body        | Response to high core body temperature           | Response to low core body temperature   |
				| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:|
				| Sweat glands in skin     | Sweat evaporates using heat from blood | Less sweat secreted hence less heat lost  |
				| Lungs, mouth and nose     | Panting increases evaporation from lungs      |   No panting means less water evaporates |
				| Hairs on skin | Hairs are flat. Less air trapped hence less insulation  |   Hairs are raised hence trap air hence increased insulation   |
				| Arterioles leading to capillaries in the skin | Vasodilation hence more heats is radiated  |   Vasoconstriction hence less heat is radiated  |
				| Liver Cells | Rate of metabolism is reduced hence less exogenic reactions occur |   Rate of metabolism increased hence more exogenic reactions occur  |
				| Skeletal muscles | No spontaneous constrictions  |   spontaneous contractions generate heat by causing muscle cells to respire |

			* *Behavior Adaptions*

				| Behavior if too hot        | Behavior if too cold           |
				| :-------------: |:-------------:|
				| Move into shade or hide in burrow     | Move into sunlight |
				| Orientate body to decrease surface area exposed to sun     | Orientate body to increase surface area exposed to sun  |
				| Remain inactive and spread out the limbs to increase surface area | Remain active and reduce surface area  |

		* *Controlling Temperature Regulation*
			* Endotherms monitor body temperature in the Hypothalamus of the brain.
				* If a drop in body temperature is detected the hypothalamus will send signals to reverse the change by:
					* increasing the rate of metabolism to increase exogenic reactions
					* release of heat from muscle contractions (shivering)
					* decrease loss of heat to the environment
				* If a rise is detected it will do the opposite
			* *Peripheral Temperature Receptors*
				* The thermoregulatory system monitors blood temperature for the hypothalamus however this isn’t the fastest
				way to get information.
				* Therefore, we have receptors on our skin and extremities which let us know the temperature at those points
				before it can affect the core body temperature so the hypothalamus can take better action to prepare against it.
