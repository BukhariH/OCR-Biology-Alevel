4.1.2 Nerves
---

a) outline the roles of sensory receptors in mammals in converting different forms of energy into nerve impulses;

b) describe, with the aid of diagrams, the structure and functions of sensory and motor neurones;

c) describe and explain how the resting potential is established and maintained;

d) describe and explain how an action potential is generated;

e) describe and explain how an action potential is transmitted in a myelinated neurone, with reference to the roles of voltage-gated sodium ion and potassium ion channels;

f) interpret graphs of the voltage changes taking place during the generation and transmission of an action potential;

g) outline the significance of the frequency of impulse transmission;

h) compare and contrast the structure and function of myelinated and non-myelinated neurones;

i) describe, with the aid of diagrams, the structure of a cholinergic synapse;

j) outline the role of neurotransmitters in the transmission of action potentials;

k) outline the roles of synapses in the nervous system.
