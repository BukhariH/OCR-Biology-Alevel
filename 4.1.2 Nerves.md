4.1.2 Nerves
---

* a) outline the roles of sensory receptors in mammals in converting different forms of energy into nerve impulses;
	* Sensory receptors are energy transducers which convert one form on energy to another. Nerves convert stimuli (which come in different forms such as heat and pressure) into electrical impulses which are carried to the central nervous system (CNS).
	
	
		| Receptor        |     Energy changes detected       |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
|Light Sensitive cells (rods and cones)| Light energy and a range of wavelengths |
|Olfactory cells in the nose| Sensitive to volatile chemicals |
|Taste buds, hard palate, epiglottis and the first part of the oesophagus| Presence of soluble chemicals |
|Pressure receptors in the skin| Pressure on skin |
|Sound receptors in the inner ear| Vibrations in the air |
|Muscle spindles| Length of muscle fibres |


* b) describe, with the aid of diagrams, the structure and functions of sensory and motor neurones; [![Khan Academy Icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/0j0g3f2t2i0i2O1B163w/favicon.ico) ](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology/neuron-nervous-system/v/anatomy-of-a-neuron)
	*

* c) describe and explain how the resting potential is established and maintained;

* d) describe and explain how an action potential is generated;

* e) describe and explain how an action potential is transmitted in a myelinated neurone, with reference to the roles of voltage-gated sodium ion and potassium ion channels;

* f) interpret graphs of the voltage changes taking place during the generation and transmission of an action potential;

* g) outline the significance of the frequency of impulse transmission;

* h) compare and contrast the structure and function of myelinated and non-myelinated neurones;

* i) describe, with the aid of diagrams, the structure of a cholinergic synapse;

* j) outline the role of neurotransmitters in the transmission of action potentials;

* k) outline the roles of synapses in the nervous system.
