5.4.3 Animal Behaviour
---

* a) explain the advantages to organisms of innate behaviour;
	* Innate behaviour is any ainmal response which occurs without the need to learn it. It is an inheirted response that occurs in all members of a simillar spieces and results in the same response to the same stimuli.
    
| Innate Behaviour        | Learned Behaviour           |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| Genetically determined hence the environment has no effect | Determined by the relationship of the genetic and environmental relationship |
| Rigid and inflexible | Can be altered with experince |
| Patterns of behaviour are the same in all members of a speices | Variety within speicies |
| Unintelligent and automatic | intelligent and intellectual  |

* b) describe escape reflexes, taxes and kineses as examples of genetically- determined innate behaviours;
	* Escape Reflexes
    	* The function of the reflex is to avoid predators.
        * They are invouleatry responses which follow a specfic pattern in response to a given stimuli.
    * Taxes (directional response)
    	* The direction of the movement is described in relation to the stimulus which triggers the behavioural response.
        * Examples:
        	* Positive phototaxis is towards & negative phototaxis away from light
            * Postive chemotaxis is towards & negative chemotaxis is away from a specific chemical.
    * Kineses (non-directional response)
    	* It is an orientation behaviour where animals increase their rate of movement without a specifc direction.
        * Such as woodlice which start darting around when exposed to light till they find better conditions.

* c) explain the meaning of the term learned behaviour;
	* Learned behaviour is a response to a stimuli which has been learned from experience.
    * This behaviour is of greatest survival benefit to animals with:
    	* with a longer lifespan and so time to learn
        * with an element of parental care of the young; which involves learning from the parent.
        * living atleast part of the time with other members of the species such as in herds & packs.
	* The main advantage of thsi behaviour is that the responses are adapted to the environment.

* d) describe habituation, imprinting, classical and operant conditioning, latent and insight learning as examples of learned behaviours;

* e) describe, using one example, the advantages of social behaviour in primates;

* f) discuss how the links between a range of human behaviours and the dopamine receptor DRD4 may contribute to the understanding of human behaviour (HSW7a);
