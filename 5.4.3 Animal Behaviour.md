5.4.3 Animal Behaviour
---

* a) explain the advantages to organisms of innate behaviour;
	* Innate behaviour is any animal response which occurs without the need to learn it. It is an inherited response that occurs in all members of a similar species and results in the same response to the same stimuli.
    
	* | Innate Behaviour        | Learned Behaviour           |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| Genetically determined hence the environment has no effect | Determined by the relationship of the genetic and environmental relationship |
| Rigid and inflexible | Can be altered with experience |
| Patterns of behaviour are the same in all members of a species | Variety within species |
| Unintelligent and automatic | intelligent and intellectual  |

* b) describe escape reflexes, taxes and kineses as examples of genetically- determined innate behaviours;
	* Escape Reflexes
    	* The function of the reflex is to avoid predators.
        * They are involuntary responses which follow a specific pattern in response to a given stimuli.
    * Taxes (directional response)
    	* The direction of the movement is described in relation to the stimulus which triggers the behavioural response.
        * Examples:
        	* Positive phototaxis is towards & negative phototaxis away from light
            * Positive chemotaxis is towards & negative chemotaxis is away from a specific chemical.
    * Kineses (non-directional response)
    	* It is an orientation behaviour where animals increase their rate of movement without a specific direction.
        * Such as woodlice which start darting around when exposed to light till they find better conditions.

* c) explain the meaning of the term learned behaviour;
	* Learned behaviour is a response to a stimuli which has been learned from experience.
    * This behaviour is of greatest survival benefit to animals with:
    	* with a longer lifespan and so time to learn
        * with an element of parental care of the young; which involves learning from the parent.
        * living atleast part of the time with other members of the species such as in herds & packs.
	* The main advantage of this behaviour is that the responses are adapted to the environment.

* d) describe habituation, imprinting, classical and operant conditioning, latent and insight learning as examples of learned behaviours;
	* Habituation
    	* Animals learn to ignore a certain stimuli because it doesn't result in reward or punishment.
        * The purpose behind it is to avoid losing energy by creating an unnecessary response to a stimuli.
        * Example:
        	* When birds learn to ignore scarecrows
	* Imprinting
		* When a young animal becomes associated with another organism (usually the parent).
		* Imprinting occurs in the sensitive period - this is around 36 hours after hatching in goslings.
		* Example:
			* Goslings become attached to the organism they interact with during the sensitive period. 
	* Classical Conditioning
		* It is a response to an unconditioned stimuli.
		* The animal learns to associate to events and responds to the first event in anticipation of the second event.
		* Example:
			* Pavlov's Dogs
	* Operant Conditioning
		* When an animal learns to associate an operation with a reward or punishment.
		* Example:
			* Skinners Box
	* Latent
		* When an organism explores it's surroundings and retains the information
		* Example:
			* Rabbits explore their burrows incase of an emergency
	* Insight Learning
		* The highest form of learning; as it's based on thinking and reasoning.
		* It forces the organism to solve a complex problem that cannot be formed by a simple reflex arc and usually requires multiple trial and error events.
		* Example:
			* Chimpanzees were presented with bananas out of their reach.
			* They stacked boxes to reach the bananas.

* e) describe, using one example, the advantages of social behaviour in primates;
	* Social organisation in gorillas.
		* They live in stable troops of around 10 individuals - with one Silverback Alpha Male, a number of mature breeding females and offspring.
		* The dominant male protects the groups, leads them in search of food and mates with the mature females.
		* As males mature they leave the group and live alone until they are mature enough to attract females.
		* Maturing females either leave or stay in the group.
	* Social behaviour in gorillas
		 * Grooming is an important social activity where one individual picks the parasites from the fur of another. 
		 	* This bonds the group together
		 * During the first 5 months the offspring stay in constant contact to the mother.
		 * The first 12 months they start to venture up to 5 meters away.
		 * The mother protects the offspring during the period.
		 * As they become juveniles they learn by playing together and imitate the adult behaviour of foraging for food.
		 * Between the ages of 3-6 years the silverback protects the young animals and is important in the learning of new skills.
		 * A variety of calls are used to signal danger and facial expressions are very important in recognition of other members.
	* Advantages of social behaviour
		* Females give birth to one or two offspring. This means the material attention and care to the animals increases survival rates of infants.
		* The young learn through the observation of play from other group members. Learned behaviour is vital for the survival of primates.
		 * The large brain size slows down the maturity of the animals.
		 * Knowledge and protection of food supply is shared between the troop.
		 * Greater ability to detect predators.

* f) discuss how the links between a range of human behaviours and the dopamine receptor DRD4 may contribute to the understanding of human behaviour (HSW7a);
	* Dopamine acts as a neurotransmitter and a hormone. It is a precursor to adrenaline and noradrenaline.
	* Abnormally low levels of dopamine are associated with Parkinson's Disease. 
		* The treatment involves the administration of L-dopa.
			* Unfortunately, the raised dopamine levels can lead to schizophrenia. 
	* Dopamine increases arousal and lowers inhibitions allowing for an increase in creativity.
	* There are five different dopamine receptors from DRD1 to DRD5 which have separate genes.
	* **DRD4 Receptor Gene**
		* 50 known variants.
		* In patients with ADHD there is an increased number of a particular variant of the DRD4 gene.
		* Other variants of the DRD4 genes are also linked with smoking and gambling.
