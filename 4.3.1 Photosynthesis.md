4.3.1 Photosynthesis
---

a) define the terms autotroph and heterotroph;

b) state that light energy is used during photosynthesis to produce complex organic molecules;

c) explain how respiration in plants and animals depends upon the products of photosynthesis;

d) state that in plants photosynthesis is a two- stage process taking place in chloroplasts;

e) explain, with the aid of diagrams and electron micrographs, how the structure of chloroplasts enables them to carry out their functions;

f) define the term photosynthetic pigment;

g) explain the importance of photosynthetic pigments in photosynthesis;

h) state that the light-dependent stage takes place in thylakoid membranes and that the light-independent stage takes place in the stroma;

i) outline how light energy is converted to chemical energy (ATP and reduced NADP) in the light-dependent stage (reference should be made to cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation, but no biochemical detail is required);

j) explain the role of water in the light-dependent stage;

k) outline how the products of the light- dependent stage are used in the light- independent stage (Calvin cycle) to produce triose phosphate (TP) (reference should be made to ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (rubisco) and glycerate 3-phosphate (GP), but no other biochemical detail is required);

l) explain the role of carbon dioxide in the light-independent stage (Calvin cycle);

m) state that TP can be used to make carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids;

n) state that most TP is recycled to RuBP;

o) describe the effect on the rate of photosynthesis, and on levels of GP, RuBP and TP, of changing carbon dioxide concentration, light intensity and temperature;

p) discuss limiting factors in photosynthesis with reference to carbon dioxide concentration, light intensity and temperature;

q) describe how to investigate experimentally the factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis (HSW3).
